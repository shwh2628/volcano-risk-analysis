# environmental impacts of volcanic eruption over time
# Purpose of this project is to analyze environmental impacts from the Kilauea eruption dating back from 1992 through to present day. I will look at land and vegetation change and pollution in the atmosphere.

# I will use data from Landsat and ASTER to analyze vegetation indexes based off of the reflectance of different wavelengths. The script for vegetation.py includes functions for this part of the analysis.

# ASTER data is also used to analyze elevation change and  emissivity.

# I will use MODIS data to study air quality - in particular Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) which indicates the level at which particles in the air prevent light from traveling through. A level of .1 is considered 'clean' , whereas a level 3 indicates aerosols are so dense that it could obscure the sun.

# With vegetation and atmospheric impact models, I will be able to create a cohesive visualization of the impacts volcanoes have environmentally, which ultimately impacts the social lives of surrounding communities.

# One could further correlate the data to health trends of the community during times of eruption and bad air quality. Agriculture could also be negatively impacted with air quality and loss of vegetation and poor soil quality. Recognizing these trends is important part of analyzing volcanic eruptions and the environmental impacts that result in specific social and economic reactions.
